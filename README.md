# Manual Testing – Login Feature (SauceDemo)

## Project Overview
This mini project is part of my continuous QA learning path.  
It demonstrates the **manual testing process** for the login functionality of the demo website [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com).

The project is built step by step over several days to simulate a **real QA workflow** —  from feature analysis, through test planning and test case design, to reporting and documentation.


## Objectives
- Show my understanding of manual software testing concepts.  
- I will improve my English, especially in the area of ​​QA and writing documentation 
- In the course of my self-education, I will gradually build a portfolio on which I will test all my knowledge  
- Prepare a foundation for future automation testing projects.


## What’s Included
- **Feature Analysis** – identification of scope, risks, and objectives.  
- **Test Plan** – overall strategy and testing approach.  
- *(coming next)* **Test Cases** – detailed positive and negative test scenarios.  
- *(coming next)* **Bug Reports & Test Summary** – defects and execution results.


## Tools & Environment
- Testing type: Manual functional testing  
- Browser: Google Chrome (latest)  
- OS: Windows 11  
- Tested website: [https://www.saucedemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com)


## Learning Goals
This repository is part of my structured QA training course created using ChatGPT  
Each phase focuses on both **QA skills** and **English writing improvement**.  
By the end of this learning path, the repository will contain complete testing documentation.
