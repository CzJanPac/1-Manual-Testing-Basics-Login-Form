# Manual Testing – Login Feature (SauceDemo)

## Project Overview
This mini project is part of my continuous QA learning path.  
It demonstrates the **manual testing process** for the login functionality of the demo website [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com).

The project was built step by step over several days to simulate a **real QA workflow** — from feature analysis, through test planning and test case design, to reporting and documentation.


## Objectives
- Demonstrate a clear understanding of manual software testing concepts.  
- Improve my English writing skills, especially in QA documentation.  
- Build a long-term QA portfolio to apply and showcase my knowledge.  
- Create a solid foundation for future automation testing projects.


## What’s Included
- **Feature Analysis** – identification of scope, risks, and objectives.  
- **Test Plan** – overall testing strategy and approach.  
- **Test Cases** – detailed positive and negative test scenarios.  
- **Bug Reports & Test Summary** – recorded defects and execution results.  
- **Traceability Matrix** – linking requirements, test cases, and bugs.


## Tools & Environment
- **Testing Type:** Manual functional testing  
- **Browser:** Google Chrome (latest)  
- **Operating System:** Windows 11  
- **Tested Website:** [https://www.saucedemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com)


## Learning Goals
This repository is part of my structured QA training program created with the help of ChatGPT.  
Each phase focuses on developing both **QA skills** and **English documentation writing**.  
By the end of this learning path, the repository will contain a full set of professional testing documentation.
